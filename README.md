Heart
=====
This project contains a simple Python script that plots my heart for my
girlfriend.


Requirements
------------
This source code in [heart.py](heart.py) should be executed with Python
3.4 or any later version of Python interpreter.

On a Windows system, the following packages must be installed for
Python 3.4 from <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>:
numpy, dateutil, pyparsing, six and matplotlib.

On a Linux system, the python3-matplotlib package and the packages it
depends on must be installed. On a Debian system, the following command
may be used to install the required packages and execute the script:

    aptitude install python3-matplotlib
    python3 heart.py

After the script runs successfully, a PNG file named
[heart-2014-02-14.png](heart-2014-02-14.png) with the plot of the heart
is created in the current working directory.
